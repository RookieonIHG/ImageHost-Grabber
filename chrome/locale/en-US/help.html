<h1>About</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many forums and blogs don’t have the capacity to store
images on their own servers. Instead, posters are required to use a third-party
host to share images. Many free image hosts exist, such as imagevenue,
imagebam, and imageshack to serve the purposes of sharing images. However,
these image hosts do not give direct links to stored images. Instead, what’s
given are links to html pages that encapsulate the images. If you want to save
an entire gallery of images that are hosted on these image hosts, simple tools
like «wget» and «downthemall» will not suffice (at least
not without some serious scripting).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ImageHost Grabber (IHG) is a powerful utility that makes the
task of downloading these galleries a simple task. You can think of it as IHG
doing all the work of «open new link, right-click, save-as». But the
functionality of IHG doesn’t stop there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IHG can automatically create the directories for you, and
even prefix file names and directories so that images you download can be
sorted chronologically and be sorted by the original page order. Years of
research of download failure recovery has been implemented into IHG to ensure
all available images are downloaded properly. If that wasn’t enough, IHG can
even save a session to try again later. IHG also includes a special feature for
forums that will allow you to download an entire thread of images. And last,
but not least, IHG uses multiple downloads to increase the download rate of the
galleries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IHG includes a host file editor so that you can implement a
new image host that is not already included. Details on doing this can be found
in the «Host File Manual» located on the IHG website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please take note that this program will not download any
attachments, images, or links to images. It only downloads images hosted on the
free image hosts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the remainder of this help document, the word
«images» will refer to the images hosted on the hosts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Supported Image Hosts</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>A list of supported image hosts can be found at the main website:&nbsp;
<a href="https://imagehostgrabber.com/hostf.html" target="_blank">ImageHost Grabber Host File</a></p>

<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Main Features</h1>

<div class=indent>

<h2>Get all pics on page</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This feature downloads all the images from the current page being displayed.</p>

<h5>How it works:</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Go to the page that you want to
download the images from. Click the «Get all pics on page», and pick
the download directory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Suck the current thread</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This feature downloads images from
multiple pages in a thread or gallery; this is what I call «sucking».
The forum style or gallery must be supported by IHG. The following forum styles
and galleries are supported: vBulletin, Studio31, Imagebeaver, Facebook,
Campusbug, Myspace, UBB Threads, PornBB, Simple Machines Forum, ProBoards,
Coppermine, e-hentai, Gelbooru, and Twitpic.</p>

<h5>How it works:</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Go to any page of the thread that
you want to «suck», click the «Suck the current thread»
menu item, enter the first page number you want to start from, the last page
number to end at, and pick the base download directory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For image galleries, go to the
album that you want to save pictures from. Then use the thread sucker like you
would on a forum. Choose a range of pages from the album that you want.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Host File Editor</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This feature allows you to modify
the host file for IHG. You can update the host file, pick a new host file, or
modify current entries in the host file.</p>

<h5>How it works:</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please refer to the special
section, «Host File Editor», for details on how it works.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Restore cached session</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This feature allows you to resume a
session that was previously saved in the download progress window.</p>

<h5>How it works:</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please refer to the special
section, «Download Progress Window», for details on how this works.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Toolbar Button</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can now put the ImageHost
Grabber toolbar button on the main toolbar for easy convenient access. It
currently only does the «Get all pics on page».</p>

<h5>How it works:</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Open the «Customize» item
under «View→Toolbars», find the ImageHost Grabber toolbar button,
and drag it to the toolbar where you want it to be located. For further help on
this topic, check out Firefox’s help file, or email me.</p>

<h1>Options</h1>

<div class=indent>

<h2>File Saving Options</h2>

<div class=indent>

<h3>Prefix filenames to reflect page order</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option will add a prefix to
the filename so that the files can be sorted in the same order as they are
displayed on the page. The first part of the prefix is an eight character long,
random alpha-numeric prefix that distinguishes the session. Each session will
have a different prefix, even when running multiple sessions at a time. Also,
when in thread sucker mode, each page will get a unique prefix. The second part
is a number that corresponds to the picture’s position on the page. The number
is padded with leading zeros so that non-logical sort algorithms can sort the
files properly (i.e. pre-WinXP and UNIX flavored OS’s).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What to do if file exists in target location</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are three options: Rename
File, Skip File, and Overwrite File. When renaming the file(s) automatically,
the extension adds an incrementing number to the end of the filename.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Autorename imagevenue and fapomatic files</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This functionality was
originality part of the «Autorename» feature from previous versions.
This modifies the filename from the file to remove the leading digits added by
these two servers. Other servers could be implemented here in future versions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Create a sub-directory with document title inside the target directory</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option will take the
document title and use that as the name of the new sub-directory to save the
media. The document title is what you see at the top of the Firefox window
(called the «Application Bar» in windows). Most of the time, this
should be a fairly unique way to identify the threads without the trouble of
typing it yourself. Sometimes, this can produce lengthy directory names, and
sometimes it is not unique enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Prefix directories to uniquely and chronologically identify them</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option will prefix a time
stamp to the directory when using the previous option. This allows the
directories to be sorted chronologically without the special effort of sorting
them yourself. The simple sorting by name, which is default for most listings,
will work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Create separate directories for each page when using thread sucker</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>When using the thread sucker, this
option will create directories for each page of a thread or gallery. The
directory names will correspond to the page numbers. If not enabled, all
images will be saved in the base directory (or automatically created directory).</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<div class=indent>

<h3>Show the Download Directory box</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option allows you to
suppress the dialog that asks you where to save the images. If you uncheck this
option, images will be saved to the last directory that was used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Show the Image Grabber menu in the tools menu</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option will allow you to
choose whether to show the ImageHost Grabber menu in the «Tools»
menu, or on the main menu bar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Remove duplicate links, even across multiple pages</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option will allow you to
remove duplicate links on the page. These are commonly found when a user
comments on a gallery and quotes the images, thus producing duplicate links.
If you’re using the thread sucker, ImageHost Grabber will look at all the pages
you are downloading for duplicate links.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Close download window when all downloads are finished</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option will close the
download window after all downloads have finished (following a 5 second
delay). If there are items that did not finish successfully, the window will
not close.</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Embedded Images</h2>

<div class=indent>

<h3>Download embedded images</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option will allow you to
download images that are «embedded» on the page. When using «Get all pics on
page», ImageHost Grabber will only download the embedded images that whose
dimensions are greater than or equal to the specified dimensions set forth by
the «Width» and «Height» control boxes. When using the thread sucker,
ImageHost Grabber will only download the embedded images whose file sizes are
greater than or equal to the specified file size in the «File size» control
box.</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Host File</h2>

<div class=indent>

<h3>Enable automatic update</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option will connect to the
online host file, to check for new hosts, every time ImageHost Grabber is
executed. You can choose to suppress the confirmation dialog, as well as
change the merge behavior.</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Host Options</h2>

<div class=indent>

<h3>Max. simultaneous connections</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the number of connections
to an image host that the extension will make at one time. In the past, there
was no control over the number of downloads from an image host; there was only control
over the number of HTTP requests. Now this option restricts both the HTTP
requests and downloads. It makes a request to the page, finds the image, and
then downloads the image. If you were to set this value to 1, then it would
download one image at a time (perfect for you dial-up users). Increasing the
number may improve performance of the download; however, too large of a number,
like more than 10, can cause connection timeouts and dropped downloads.
Although this extension includes an automatic cancel/retry feature for long
connection times, this can seriously slow down the entire process if it has to
retry a lot of connections. It has been my experience that 5 is the golden
number for most high speed internet connections. The number can also be limited
by the image host, and the time of day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Max. number of retries for each link</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option lets you specify how
many times it should retry each link before it gives up and moves on. The
following conditions will cause a link to be retried:</p>

<ul>
	<li class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst>incomplete request (but Firefox thinks it was complete)</li>
	<li class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>request is taking too long (probably because the server gave up but Firefox didn’t)</li>
	<li class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>the request was cancelled by the server or by Firefox (for some un-godly reason)</li>
	<li class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>there was some kind of error in the request</li>
	<li class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast>the server sent you a file, but it’s not an image</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also note that there are other
cases where request is turned over to the retry function, but not because
anything went wrong, but because an alternate URL was found. These other cases
won’t affect the retry count.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Request timeout before retry (in seconds)</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option lets to specify how
long the extension should try each request before sending the request to the
retry function.</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>

<div class=indent>

<h3>Enable Console Logging</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option turns on the console
logs. Use this if the extension doesn’t work, or a feature of the extension
doesn’t work. This will record the fatal errors reported on the error console
into a log file that you can then send to the developer. This will decrease
system performance slightly. This won’t help you if the extension is working,
but isn’t doing what you expected it to do (that’s called a logical error, and
is harder to debug). An example where you would want to enable this would be if
you click on «Get all pics on page» and it does nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note: Firefox has to be restarted after enabling this option.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Enable Debugging Log</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option turns on the
debugging logs. Use this if the extension is working but is doing something
different than what is expected. For instance, you click «Get all pics on
page» and it downloads all the files, but the images it downloads aren’t
the ones you wanted. This is called a logical error. This is much harder to
debug than a syntax error (as described above). Because it is harder to debug,
a very verbose output of the program execution is made. As a result, system
performance will drop very noticeably. You should be careful with using this
feature. Try to use a page with a small amount of images (i.e. 20 or less). And
when you’re done, copy the log to a local folder and clear the log. The log
file can get to several hundred kilobytes in a single run.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note: Firefox has to be restarted after enabling this option.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Clear Debug Log</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use this to clear the debug log.
This is a good idea after doing a single run through. The log file will get
fairly large real quick. You will want to wait to do this until after you copy
the log file to a local folder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Copy Debug Log to Local Folder</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use this to copy the log file to
a folder located somewhere on your hard drive/desktop/storage device. You do
not have a choice in the name of the file; it will be «log.txt». Once
it is copied, you can read it, or stick it in your bum or the better choice,
email it to the developer.</p>

</div>

</div>

<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Download Progress Window</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The download progress window contains features that are not
available anywhere else in ImageHost Grabber. In general, you can add multiple
sessions, you can preview a file after it has finished downloading, you can
restart and retry downloads, and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<div class=indent>

<h2>General Features</h2>

<ul>
	<li class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst>You can open the file after it has finished downloading by double clicking on the entry item</li>
	<li class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>You can select multiple items in sequence by clicking on the first item in the sequence, hold the shift key, and click the last item in the sequence</li>
	<li class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>You can select multiple items (not in sequence) by clicking on the first item, then while holding on the control key, click on each subsequent item to be selected</li>
	<li class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast>You can perform actions on an item (or selection of items) by right clicking on that item (or any item in the selection)</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Auto Clear Finished</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Automatically clears downloads from the window as they are finished downloading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Suppress Popup</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option suppresses the popup
behavior of the download progress window when adding more downloads to the
window. The window must already be open for this to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Clear All Finished</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allows you to clear all the finished downloads from the window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Stop All Sessions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This feature will allow you to stop
all downloads in progress. It causes each download to abort, regardless of
which session.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Revive All Stopped Sessions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This feature will allow you to
re-start the previously stopped sessions. Each session will start with the
previously stopped downloads, retrying them, and then continue with the rest of
the session.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Save session to cache</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This allows you to save all the
items in the window to cache, which can be recalled later using the «Restore cached
session» feature in the main ImageHost Grabber menu. This is helpful if you’re
having connection problems or whatever and you don’t want to lose all the time
you put into building the download list.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Actions on selected items</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of the actions on selected
items are performed by right-clicking on the item(s) and selecting the action
to be performed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<div class=indent>

<h3>Open file</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This action will open only the
item which has focus. For instance, if you right click on the third item in a
selection list, only the third item will be opened. The «Open file» action
passes control over to the operating system to open the file in the default
program that handles the file type.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Open containing folder</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This action will open the
containing folder for the item that has focus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Remove from list</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This allows you to remove one or more item(s) from the list.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Abort download/request</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This feature allows you to cancel one
or more requests for whatever reason. This might be an option you would
consider if it is taking too long and you want to retry it at a later time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Retry download/request</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This feature will allow you to
retry one or more downloads that have been aborted, completed successfully, or
that is in progress. It will retry from the current progress of the download(s).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Restart Download</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This feature restarts the
download(s) completely, regardless of the progress. It starts with a fresh
download, not resuming from any previous progress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Reset the retry count to zero</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This feature allows you to reset
the retry count of the selected item(s). It is useful if there were connection
problems that inflated the retry count and you want to try again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>View Request Details</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This feature will allow you to
view the details of the request, such as where the file is being saved, the thumbnail’s
URL, and the HTML associated with the thumbnail page.</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Export list to HTML</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This button allows you to save the
download list as an html file. The html file can then be opened in the main
browser window and re-processed by running «Get all pics on page».</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Max. requests and Max. retries</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>These two controls allow you to
instantaneously control the maximum number of requests and retries for the
download process. The changes take effect immediately.</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the unique identifying label for an entry in the host file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>URL Pattern</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the regular expression that corresponds to the image hosts URL pattern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Search Pattern</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the part that finds the
image on the resulting page. Please refer to the «Host File Editor» on the
main page for in depth discussion about the search pattern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Save Changes</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This updates the host file with any
changes you may have made to an existing entry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Add Host</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This adds a new entry to the host
file given information entered into the first three fields.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Delete Host</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This deletes the entry from the host file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Modify hostf servers</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is where you can add other
sources of online host file updates. Simply enter the URL of the new host file
location.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Pick Host File</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This allows you to pick a host file
other than the one residing in ImageHost Grabber’s extension folder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Reset to Default Host File</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This uses the host file that resides in ImageHost Grabber’s extension folder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Merge Host File</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This will allow you to merge the
entries in a host file (other than the one you’re using) with the host file
that you’re currently using.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Update from online Host file</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This allows you to receive the most
